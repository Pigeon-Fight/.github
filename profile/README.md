# 🎮 Gameplay 🎮

All of the game processes are secure, transparent, and entirely on-chain, ensuring that users fully own their minted NFTs. Once minted, the NFT can be used in the game, allowing players to battle, upgrade, and interact with other players.

To start playing **Pigeon Fight**, users need to own at least one NFT pigeon from our collection on the **TON network**. Below is an overview of the gameplay workflow:

## Step 1: Select & Mint a NFT

1. **Choose a Pigeon Class**: Users begin by selecting the pigeon class they want to mint. Each class has unique abilities and characteristics that impact gameplay.
2. **Deposit TON**: Based on the selected class, users deposit the required TON amount to cover the class price.
3. **Mint NFT**: Once the deposit is made, a transaction is initiated on the **TON network**. The smart contract for the NFT collection mints a new NFT, assigning ownership to the user’s wallet address.

The **TON transaction** for NFT minting follows these steps:

## Step 2: Upgrade Your NFT

1. **Earn Upgrade Points**: Players can gain upgrade points by fighting other NFT pigeons and winning battles.
2. **Select an NFT to Upgrade**: When enough upgrade points are collected, the user can choose an NFT from their collection to upgrade.
3. **Send an Upgrade Message**: To initiate the upgrade, the player sends a message to the NFT smart contract, specifying which attributes to enhance.
4. **Attribute Enhancement**: Players can allocate upgrade points to any of the following five attributes:
   - **Health Point (HP)**: Increases the durability of the NFT in battle.
   - **Energy**: Allows for more battles or actions in the game.
   - **Attack**: Enhances the offensive power against other NFT pigeons.
   - **Defense**: Reduces the damage taken during battles.
   - **Speed**: Improves the chance of striking first in battle.

With each upgrade, the pigeon NFT becomes stronger and better equipped for future battles, creating a continuous gameplay loop where players can strengthen their assets and face increasingly challenging opponents.

## Step 3: Challenge Opponents & Earn Experience

1. **Find an Opponent**: Users can browse and select an opponent NFT pigeon to challenge, keeping in mind that they need to choose an opponent they have a high chance of defeating to gain experience points.
2. **Battle On-Chain**: The battle takes place fully on-chain, with the outcome determined by comparing the stats of both NFTs. Each pigeon’s **Attack**, **Defense**, **HP**, **Energy**, and **Speed** attributes are used to calculate the winner.
3. **Earn Experience Points**: Winning against a more powerful opponent earns more experience points, which can later be used for upgrades.
4. **Update Attributes**: After the battle, both pigeons’ **Health Point (HP)** and **Energy** attributes are updated based on the battle’s outcome. This adjustment reflects the toll taken by each pigeon during the fight.

Each battle provides a new opportunity for players to advance, upgrade, and strengthen their NFTs, making each victory a step toward creating the ultimate pigeon fighter.

## Step 4: Healing Your NFT

1. **Maintain Optimal Health & Energy**: To maximize the chances of winning, players must ensure that their NFT pigeon remains in peak condition with high **HP** and **Energy**.
2. **Purchase Healing Items**: Players can buy healing items from the in-game shop to restore their NFT’s health and energy. Different items offer varying effects, such as:
   - **Potion**: Restores full health and energy.
   - **Onigiri**: Restores half of the health.
   - **Hotdog**: Fully restores health.
   - **Orange**: Restores half of the energy.
   - **Popcorn**: Fully restores energy.
3. **Price Variation**: Each healing item has a different price, based on its effectiveness. Strategic item selection ensures players get the best value for the recovery needs of their NFT.

By keeping their NFTs in optimal condition through regular healing, players can increase their winning potential in battles, making each fight a rewarding step toward mastery.

# 🤑 Transaction Sponsor (Paymaster) using AEON payment

To make **Pigeon Fight** more accessible and user-friendly, we’ve integrated the **AEON Payment System**, a third-party solution that simplifies in-game transactions and enhances the overall user experience. Here's what AEON integration brings to the game:

- **Easy Onboarding**: New players can start playing without needing any TON tokens in their wallet, removing barriers for first-time users.
- **Flexible Payments**: Players can pay using a wide variety of tokens or even fiat currency, providing maximum convenience and choice.
- **Backup for Low TON Balance**: If a player’s TON balance is insufficient to purchase in-game items, AEON can step in to cover the transaction.

### Payment Workflow

The **AEON Payment Workflow** ensures a seamless transaction process for players. Below is an outline of how it works:

1. **Transaction Request**: The player initiates a payment to purchase an in-game item or service.
2. **Payment Gateway**: AEON processes the payment, allowing the player to pay with any supported token or fiat.
3. **Conversion to TON**: The payment is converted to TON tokens, which are then used to complete the transaction on the **TON network**.
4. **Transaction Confirmation**: Once the TON payment is successful, the in-game item or service is delivered to the player.

This integration ensures that players can enjoy the game without worrying about TON token availability or compatibility issues. AEON makes transactions fast, secure, and effortless, keeping the focus on the gameplay.
